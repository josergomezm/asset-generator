# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Asset Generation Tool is a web application that helps users create consistent visual assets (images and videos) for their projects. The tool focuses on maintaining cohesive art styles across all generated assets within a project by allowing users to define style guidelines and reference materials. Built with Vue.js frontend and Node.js backend, it provides a streamlined workflow from project setup to asset creation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to create and manage multiple projects, so that I can organize my asset generation work by different applications or campaigns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a project list view
2. WHEN a user clicks "Create New Project" THEN the system SHALL display a project creation form
3. WHEN a user fills out project details (name, description, context) THEN the system SHALL save the project and redirect to the project dashboard
4. WHEN a user views the project list THEN the system SHALL display all projects with their names, descriptions, and creation dates
5. WHEN a user clicks on a project THEN the system SHALL navigate to that project's dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to define an art style for each project with examples and descriptions, so that all generated assets maintain visual consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or edits a project THEN the system SHALL provide fields for art style definition including text description and example images
2. WHEN a user uploads example images THEN the system SHALL store and display them as style references
3. WHEN a user saves style settings THEN the system SHALL associate them with the project for use in asset generation
4. WHEN a user views project settings THEN the system SHALL display current art style configuration with all reference materials
5. IF a project has no art style defined THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to set up style guidelines before asset creation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to create different types of assets (images, videos, or text prompts) within a project, so that I can generate all the content I need for my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in a project dashboard THEN the system SHALL display options to create images, videos, or text prompts
2. WHEN a user selects an asset type THEN the system SHALL display the appropriate creation interface
3. WHEN a user creates an asset THEN the system SHALL apply the project's art style settings to maintain consistency
4. WHEN a user generates an asset THEN the system SHALL save it to the project and display it in the asset gallery
5. WHEN a user views the project dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all created assets organized by type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to view and manage all assets within a project, so that I can organize, review, and reuse my generated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a project dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all assets in a gallery format
2. WHEN a user clicks on an asset THEN the system SHALL display asset details including generation parameters and preview
3. WHEN a user wants to delete an asset THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation and remove it upon approval
4. WHEN a user wants to download an asset THEN the system SHALL provide download functionality in appropriate formats
5. WHEN a user searches or filters assets THEN the system SHALL display matching results based on type, name, or creation date

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the asset generation to automatically incorporate my project's art style, so that I don't have to manually specify style parameters for each asset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates an asset THEN the system SHALL automatically include the project's art style description in the generation prompt
2. WHEN a user generates an asset AND the project has reference images THEN the system SHALL use them to influence the generation process
3. WHEN a user generates an asset THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with previously generated assets in the same project
4. IF a user wants to override the default style THEN the system SHALL allow temporary style modifications for individual assets
5. WHEN an asset is generated THEN the system SHALL store the final prompt and parameters used for future reference

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want a responsive web interface that works on desktop and mobile devices, so that I can manage my projects and assets from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on any device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for that screen size
2. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and maintain state
3. WHEN a user uploads files on mobile THEN the system SHALL support mobile file selection and camera access
4. WHEN a user views assets on mobile THEN the system SHALL display them in a mobile-optimized gallery layout
5. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading states and feedback
